# Python Tutorial

This is a tutorial for those who have experience in other programming languages and 
prefer to learn visually rather than reading text or watching hours long tutorials. 
My goal with this tutorial is to take everything I have learned about Python and create
a simple guide for reference. I would recommend as another resource the [official python
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) as it provides an indepth
look into various aspects of python. This guide will seek to be as simple and brief as 
possible, assuming that the reader kind of has an idea of what they are doing. This
tutorial is divided up into large sections which cover great amount of material. These
sections can be seen in the Table of Contents.
